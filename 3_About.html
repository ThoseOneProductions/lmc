    really my first big jump was off the washing /drying machine when i was like 4, i still remember getting inside the basket and pretending i was in a ship or something and wiggled myself off right onto my head. All i know is that after that i was just happy to be alive and maybe thats the first time i experienced consciousness now that i think about it. 

The next time was when i was in first grade sitting in class thinking about how i was lucky to be born here and not in china, it still blows my mind that i appeared out of nowhere into oklahoma one day. 

we really are on the middle of the map when you look at it so when i realized my place in the world i was really like how did i get so lucky. also its weird i'm right in the middle of the country but whatever.

somehow we all ended up alive one day and here we are sharing our lives through a piece of technology most people probably laughed at the idea of 20 years ago 

i wonder how many great ideas get laughed at that in 20 more years will be the new standard of life.

for all we know we will be using Nerualink or something similar regularly before we know it. 

Im sure not many people could predict the current state of technology today so who knows what will be available soon.

I'm really excited to see what music turns into when people are able to create with their minds and stuff that should be fun.

i want to make a VR Music Production workstation DAW.

I guarantee there will be games in the future where you use your brain power to outplay others, similar to games now but more with using your mind 100% instead of physical interaction. Think like chess but on another level.

i think music will explore more into the subconscious and be more scientific in the future, focused more on what certain frequencies do to our bodies and such. 

i know some artists and producers are already aware of this but im thinking it will be more common knowledge in the future. 

imagine instead of learning do re me fa so la ti do in music class you learn how different frequencies change your mood and the power of manifestation. Maybe thats too much power though.
